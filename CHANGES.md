## Changes

### 0.1.0b4 (unreleased)

#### Features

- Add support for [reproducible builds] which are now enabled by
  default. When enabled, timestamps in the zip archive are set to a
  fixed value (configurable via the `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment
  variable) and the UNIX access modes of archive members are
  [normalized to either 0644 or 0755][mode-normalization] depending on
  whether the file is executable or not.

### 0.1.0b3 (2023-05-10)

#### Features

- Refactor JSON metadata code. Now we use `hatchling` to generate
  conventionall RFC 822-formatted distribution metadata, then convert
  that to JSON, explicitly following the steps outline in [PEP
  566](https://peps.python.org/pep-0566/#json-compatible-metadata).
  Among other things, this allows configuration of the
  *Metadata-Version* by setting
  `tool.hatch.build.targets.zipped-directory.core-metadata-version`.

#### Tests

- We now have 100% test coverage.

### 0.1.0b2 (2023-01-10)

#### Features

- The prefixing of file names under a top-level directory in the zip
  archive can now be disabled by setting `install-name = ""`.
  Thank you @gwerbin([#1][])

#### Bugs

- Use explicit encoding in hatch metadata hook (for Windows).
